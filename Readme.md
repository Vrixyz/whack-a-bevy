# Goal

- Participate in [first Bevy Jam](https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-1)
- Multiplayer [whack a mole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whac-A-Mole)

# Game details

- Whack a mole
- **every player** is on the **same** map!
    - kinda wordle inspired
- player drop in or out of the game

## Nice to haves
- maybe different type of moles ?
- time limited or not ?
- ranking
- sharing

# Theme interpretation

- Players playing for a longer time than others have the unfair advantage that they had more chances to whack some bevies!
- Players with better connection have an unfair advantage
